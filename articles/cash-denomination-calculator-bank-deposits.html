                    <p>Depositing cash at an Indian bank is more than walking up to the counter and handing over a stack of notes. Banks require a <strong>denomination breakdown</strong> &mdash; a slip listing how many notes and coins of each denomination you are depositing, along with per-denomination subtotals and a grand total. This guide explains the entire process, the RBI regulations behind it, and how a <a href="/">denomination calculator like Cash Denomination Calculator</a> helps you prepare your deposit before you reach the bank.</p>

                    <h2 id="why-banks-require">Why Banks Require Denomination Details with Cash Deposits</h2>

                    <p>When you deposit cash, the bank needs to count and verify the exact amount. A denomination breakdown serves three purposes:</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Verification efficiency:</strong> When the cashier knows you are depositing 30 notes of &#8377;500 and 45 notes of &#8377;100, they can count each denomination separately and verify against your slip. This is faster and more reliable than counting a mixed pile of notes.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Counterfeit detection:</strong> Denomination-wise counting allows the cashier to examine notes of each denomination carefully. The RBI reported <strong>21.6 crore counterfeit notes</strong> detected in FY2023&ndash;24 <sup>[1]</sup>. Sorting by denomination makes it easier to spot fakes, especially in the &#8377;500 denomination, which accounts for 86.5% of the value of notes in circulation.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Regulatory compliance:</strong> The RBI&rsquo;s Master Direction on Currency Distribution and Exchange <sup>[2]</sup> requires banks to maintain records of cash transactions. A denomination slip provides an auditable record for the bank&rsquo;s internal ledger and for reporting to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND) when required.</p>

                    <h2 id="denomination-vs-deposit">Denomination Slip vs. Deposit Slip: What Is the Difference?</h2>

                    <p>These two documents serve different purposes and are often confused:</p>

                    <p>A <strong>deposit slip</strong> (also called a pay-in slip) is the main document for a cash deposit. It records your account number, name, branch, date, the total amount being deposited, and your signature. Every bank provides pre-printed deposit slips in the branch and in chequebooks.</p>

                    <p>A <strong>denomination slip</strong> is the attached breakdown that lists each currency denomination, the count of notes/coins, and the per-denomination subtotal. It is submitted alongside the deposit slip. While the deposit slip tells the bank <em>how much</em> you are depositing and <em>where</em>, the denomination slip tells them <em>what</em> you are depositing in terms of specific notes and coins.</p>

                    <p>At most banks, the denomination details are either printed on the reverse of the deposit slip or provided as a separate slip. Cash Denomination Calculator generates a standalone denomination sheet that can be attached to any bank&rsquo;s deposit slip.</p>

                    <h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step: Depositing Cash at Major Indian Banks</h2>

                    <p>The core process is the same across banks, with minor variations in forms and thresholds. Here is the general process, with bank-specific notes:</p>

                    <h3 id="step-1-prepare">Step 1: Prepare Your Cash at Home or Office</h3>

                    <p>Before visiting the bank, sort your cash by denomination and count each pile. Enter the counts into <a href="/">Cash Denomination Calculator</a> and either print the denomination sheet or keep it open on your phone. Having the denomination breakdown ready before you reach the bank saves 10&ndash;15 minutes of writing at the counter.</p>

                    <h3 id="step-2-fill">Step 2: Fill the Deposit Slip</h3>

                    <p>At the bank, take a deposit slip (pay-in slip) from the counter. Fill in your account number, name, branch code (if required), date, and the total amount in both figures and words. Cash Denomination Calculator provides the amount in words in the correct Indian English format, which you can copy directly.</p>

                    <h3 id="step-3-denomination">Step 3: Attach Denomination Details</h3>

                    <p>Most banks have a denomination grid on the reverse of the deposit slip. Fill it in from your Cash Denomination Calculator printout or show the printed sheet to the cashier. If the bank accepts separate denomination sheets (most do), simply staple your Cash Denomination Calculator printout to the deposit slip.</p>

                    <h3 id="step-4-submit">Step 4: Submit at the Counter</h3>

                    <p>Hand over the cash, the deposit slip, and the denomination sheet at the cash counter. The cashier will count the cash denomination-wise and verify against your slip. Once verified, they stamp the counterfoil (your receipt) with the date, amount, and branch seal.</p>

                    <h3 id="bank-specific">Bank-Specific Notes</h3>

                    <p><strong>State Bank of India (SBI):</strong> SBI uses a standardised multi-part pay-in slip with denomination details on the reverse. The denomination format lists &#8377;500, &#8377;200, &#8377;100, &#8377;50, &#8377;20, &#8377;10, &#8377;5, &#8377;2, &#8377;1 with columns for quantity and amount. This matches Cash Denomination Calculator&rsquo;s output exactly. SBI branches generally accept printed denomination sheets stapled to the deposit slip.</p>

                    <p><strong>HDFC Bank:</strong> HDFC uses its own deposit slip format with denomination details. Cash deposits above &#8377;50,000 require PAN. HDFC branches with cash deposit machines (CDMs) accept bundled notes without manual denomination counting, but you still need a receipt with the denomination breakdown for your records.</p>

                    <p><strong>ICICI Bank:</strong> ICICI&rsquo;s deposit slip includes a denomination section. For large deposits, ICICI may ask for advance intimation (call ahead). Cash deposits at ICICI CDMs are available at select branches for account holders.</p>

                    <p><strong>Punjab National Bank (PNB), Bank of Baroda, Union Bank:</strong> Nationalised banks follow standard RBI formats closely. Denomination details are expected on the reverse of the deposit slip. These banks are generally the most accommodating of printed denomination sheets from tools like Cash Denomination Calculator.</p>

                    <h2 id="rbi-guidelines">RBI Guidelines on Cash Deposit Reporting</h2>

                    <p>The RBI and Income Tax Department have specific rules about cash deposits. Understanding these rules helps you prepare correctly and avoid unnecessary scrutiny:</p>

                    <h3 id="pan-requirement">PAN Requirement (&#8377;50,000+)</h3>

                    <p>Under the RBI&rsquo;s KYC Direction <sup>[3]</sup>, any single cash deposit of <strong>&#8377;50,000 or more</strong> requires the depositor to provide their Permanent Account Number (PAN). If you do not have a PAN, you must submit Form 60 with a declaration. This applies to deposits into your own account as well as third-party deposits.</p>

                    <h3 id="ctr">Cash Transaction Report (&#8377;10 Lakh+)</h3>

                    <p>Banks are required to file a <strong>Cash Transaction Report (CTR)</strong> with the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) for:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Aggregate cash deposits exceeding <strong>&#8377;10 lakh in a savings account</strong> in a financial year</li>
                        <li>Aggregate cash deposits exceeding <strong>&#8377;50 lakh in a current account</strong> in a financial year</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This is an automatic reporting requirement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). It does not mean the deposit is illegal or that you are under investigation. It simply means the bank reports the transaction to FIU-IND, which monitors for suspicious patterns.</p>

                    <h3 id="section-269st">Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act</h3>

                    <p>Section 269ST prohibits any person from <strong>receiving &#8377;2 lakh or more in cash</strong> in a single transaction, from a single person in a day, or in relation to a single event <sup>[4]</sup>. This applies to businesses receiving payment, not to bank deposits. However, if you are depositing large amounts of cash received from business transactions, you should ensure the underlying receipt complied with Section 269ST. Violation attracts a penalty equal to the amount received.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Important distinction:</strong> Section 269ST restricts <em>receiving</em> cash from another person, not <em>depositing</em> your own cash at a bank. You can deposit any amount of your own legitimately earned income at a bank. The restrictions and reporting requirements exist to prevent money laundering and tax evasion, not to limit lawful banking.
                    </div>

                    <h2 id="using-cashcalc">How to Use Cash Denomination Calculator to Prepare Your Bank Deposit</h2>

                    <p>Here is the recommended workflow for preparing a cash deposit using Cash Denomination Calculator:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Sort your cash</strong> by denomination at home or your shop. Count each pile.</li>
                        <li><strong>Open Cash Denomination Calculator</strong> on your phone or computer and enter the count for each denomination.</li>
                        <li><strong>Verify the grand total</strong> matches your expected amount. Check the amount in words.</li>
                        <li><strong>Print the denomination sheet</strong> using the Print button. If you do not have a printer, take a screenshot or keep the page open on your phone.</li>
                        <li><strong>At the bank,</strong> fill the deposit slip with the total amount (from Cash Denomination Calculator), attach or present the denomination sheet, and submit with your cash.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>This entire process takes 5&ndash;7 minutes at home and eliminates the need to write denomination details by hand at the bank counter.</p>

                    <h2 id="format">The Format Banks Expect for Denomination Breakdowns</h2>

                    <p>The standard denomination format used by Indian banks is a simple table:</p>

                    <div class="table-responsive"><table class="comparison-table">
                        <thead>
                            <tr><th>Denomination</th><th>Count</th><th>Amount (&#8377;)</th></tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr><td>&#8377;500</td><td>30</td><td>15,000</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>&#8377;200</td><td>10</td><td>2,000</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>&#8377;100</td><td>25</td><td>2,500</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>&#8377;50</td><td>18</td><td>900</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>&#8377;20</td><td>8</td><td>160</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>&#8377;10</td><td>40</td><td>400</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>&#8377;5</td><td>12</td><td>60</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>&#8377;2</td><td>5</td><td>10</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>&#8377;1</td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr>
                            <tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Grand Total</strong></td><td><strong>21,038</strong></td></tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table></div>

                    <p>Cash Denomination Calculator generates exactly this format, including the grand total in both figures and words (&ldquo;Twenty-One Thousand and Thirty-Eight Rupees Only&rdquo;). The Print output is formatted for A4 paper and includes a date stamp.</p>

                    <h2 id="large-deposits">Tips for Large Cash Deposits</h2>

                    <p>If you are depositing a large amount (&#8377;1 lakh or more), follow these additional tips:</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Call ahead:</strong> Inform your bank branch in advance, especially if depositing above &#8377;5 lakh. Some branches need to arrange for additional cash-handling staff or vault access.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Carry proper ID:</strong> Bring your PAN card (mandatory for &#8377;50,000+), one photo ID (Aadhaar, voter ID, or passport), and your bank passbook or statement as proof of account.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Have your denomination sheet ready:</strong> A pre-prepared denomination sheet (from Cash Denomination Calculator) shows the bank you are organised and have already counted your cash. This speeds up verification and reduces the likelihood of discrepancies.</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Sort and bundle:</strong> Bundle notes by denomination in groups of 50 or 100, facing the same direction. This is how bank cashiers prefer to receive cash, and it speeds up their verification process significantly.</p>

                    <p><strong>5. Keep a copy:</strong> Download the Cash Denomination Calculator PDF and keep it in your records. This serves as your personal proof of the denomination breakdown in case of any dispute.</p>

                    <p><strong>6. Visit during non-peak hours:</strong> Cash deposits at busy branches can take 30&ndash;45 minutes during peak hours (11 AM &ndash; 1 PM, salary days). Visit between 10&ndash;11 AM or 3&ndash;4 PM for shorter waits.</p>

                    <p>Most banks do not charge for basic cash deposits into your own account, but there are exceptions for large or frequent deposits:</p>

                    <h2 id="print-feature">How Cash Denomination Calculator&rsquo;s Print Feature Creates Bank-Ready Sheets</h2>

                    <p>Cash Denomination Calculator&rsquo;s Print button generates a denomination sheet specifically designed for bank deposits:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Standard format:</strong> Denomination, count, and subtotal columns matching bank slip formats</li>
                        <li><strong>Grand total in figures and words:</strong> Both formats shown, as required by deposit slips</li>
                        <li><strong>Date stamp:</strong> Automatically includes the current date for record-keeping</li>
                        <li><strong>Clean layout:</strong> Formatted for A4 paper with clear typography and adequate spacing</li>
                        <li><strong>No Cash Denomination Calculator branding:</strong> The printout looks professional and bank-appropriate</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you do not have a printer, you can save the print output as a PDF (most browsers support &ldquo;Save as PDF&rdquo; in the print dialog) or show it to the cashier on your phone screen. Many bank cashiers now accept digital denomination sheets shown on mobile devices, though policies vary by branch.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('is-open')">Is PAN mandatory for all cash deposits? <span class="faq-icon">&#9662;</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>PAN is mandatory for single cash deposits of &#8377;50,000 or more. If you do not have a PAN, you must submit Form 60 with a declaration. For deposits below &#8377;50,000, PAN is not required, but banks may ask for basic KYC documents.</p></div></div>
                        <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('is-open')">What happens if I deposit more than &#8377;10 lakh in a year? <span class="faq-icon">&#9662;</span></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Banks are required to file a Cash Transaction Report (CTR) with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND) for aggregate cash deposits exceeding &#8377;10 lakh in a savings account or &#8377;50 lakh in a current account in a financial year. This is an automatic reporting requirement &mdash; it does not mean the deposit is illegal.</p></div></div>

Deposits above &#8377;50,000 into someone else&rsquo;s account require the depositor&rsquo;s PAN or Form 60, valid photo ID, full name and address, and the relationship with the account holder.</p></div></div>

Cash Denomination Calculator generates this exact format. However, some branches may additionally require you to fill their own form. Having your denomination sheet ready still speeds up the process significantly.</p></div></div>
