                    <!-- Introduction -->
                    <p>If you have ever deposited cash at a bank in India, you have likely encountered a <strong>cash denomination sheet</strong> &mdash; that small form where you write down how many notes and coins of each denomination you are depositing. Despite the rise of digital payments, this paper form remains a cornerstone of cash banking operations across the country. Whether you are a shopkeeper making a daily deposit at SBI, a chartered accountant reconciling petty cash, or an individual depositing savings, understanding the correct denomination sheet format saves time and prevents errors at the bank counter.</p>

                    <p>This article explains what a denomination sheet is, shows you the standard Indian format, walks you through filling one step by step, covers bank-specific variations, identifies common mistakes, and introduces how our <a href="/">online denomination calculator</a> can replace the entire paper process.</p>

                    <h2 id="what-is">What Is a Cash Denomination Sheet?</h2>

                    <p>A cash denomination sheet &mdash; also called a denomination slip, denomination memo, or cash breakdown form &mdash; is a structured document that breaks down a total cash amount into its individual denominations. Instead of stating &ldquo;I am depositing &#8377;47,350,&rdquo; a denomination sheet specifies that the amount consists of, say, 80 notes of &#8377;500, 12 notes of &#8377;200, 35 notes of &#8377;100, 27 notes of &#8377;50, and so on until every note and coin is accounted for.</p>

                    <p>Denomination sheets are used in three primary contexts. In banking, they accompany cash deposit slips to help tellers verify the deposited amount. In business, they serve as end-of-day cash reconciliation records for shops, offices, and warehouses. In government, they are used by treasuries, municipal offices, and public sector units for cash custody records. The Reserve Bank of India&rsquo;s Master Circular on Currency Distribution requires banks to maintain denomination-wise records of cash holdings, and the denomination sheet at the customer level feeds into this broader tracking system <sup>[1]</sup>.</p>

                    <h2 id="standard-format">Standard Format of an Indian Cash Denomination Sheet</h2>

                    <p>While individual banks may add their own branding and additional fields, the core structure of a denomination sheet is universal across India. Every sheet contains three essential columns: the denomination value, the number of notes or coins, and the calculated amount for that denomination. The denominations are listed from highest to lowest, starting with &#8377;500 notes and ending with &#8377;1 coins. Here is the standard format used by most Indian banks:</p>

                    <div class="table-responsive">
                    <table class="comparison-table">
                        <thead>
                            <tr><th>Denomination (&#8377;)</th><th>Number of Notes/Coins</th><th>Amount (&#8377;)</th></tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr><td>500</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>200</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>100</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>50</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>20</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>10</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>5</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>2</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>1</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                            <tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td>___</td><td><strong>&#8377;___</strong></td></tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    </div>

                    <p>Below the table, most bank denomination slips also include fields for the depositor&rsquo;s name, account number, date, branch name, and signature. Some banks add a field for the total amount in words, which is required under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 for financial documents <sup>[2]</sup>.</p>

                    <h2 id="how-to-fill">How to Fill a Cash Denomination Sheet &mdash; Step by Step</h2>

                    <p>Filling a denomination sheet correctly is straightforward once you understand the process, but many people rush through it and make avoidable errors. The first step is to sort your cash by denomination. Separate all &#8377;500 notes into one pile, all &#8377;200 notes into another, and continue until every denomination has its own pile. This initial sorting is the foundation of an accurate count &mdash; trying to count mixed currency will inevitably lead to errors.</p>

                    <p>Once sorted, count each denomination pile separately. For large piles, count in batches of 10 or 25 notes and keep a running tally. When you are confident in the count for a denomination, enter the number in the &ldquo;Number of Notes/Coins&rdquo; column of the corresponding row. Do this for every denomination, including coins &mdash; many people forget to count &#8377;5, &#8377;2, and &#8377;1 coins, which leads to a mismatch at the bank counter.</p>

                    <p>Next, calculate the amount for each denomination by multiplying the count by the face value. For example, if you have 47 notes of &#8377;200, the amount is 47 &times; 200 = &#8377;9,400. Enter this in the &ldquo;Amount&rdquo; column. Finally, add all the amounts in the &ldquo;Amount&rdquo; column to arrive at the grand total. This grand total must match the amount you write on your deposit slip. Double-check by adding the amounts column twice &mdash; once from top to bottom and once from bottom to top. If both sums match, your sheet is correct.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Instead of doing all this arithmetic by hand, use the <a href="/">Cash Denomination Calculator</a> on our homepage. Enter the counts, and the tool instantly calculates all subtotals and the grand total. You can then print the result as a ready-to-use denomination sheet.
                    </div>

                    <h2 id="bank-specific">Bank-Specific Denomination Slip Formats</h2>

                    <p>While the core structure is universal, banks add their own variations that are worth knowing about. SBI denomination slips include all nine active denominations and have separate sections for notes and coins at some branches, particularly those in rural areas where coin deposits are more common. The SBI slip also includes a pre-printed line for the depositor&rsquo;s Customer ID, which is different from the account number.</p>

                    <p>HDFC Bank uses a combined deposit-cum-denomination slip where the denomination breakdown is printed on the back of the deposit slip itself, eliminating the need for a separate form. ICICI Bank follows a similar approach, with the denomination table printed below the main deposit form on the same page. PNB and Bank of Baroda still use separate denomination slips at most branches, and some of their older printed forms still include a row for the &#8377;2,000 denomination, which was withdrawn from active circulation by the RBI on 19 May 2023.</p>

                    <p>Regardless of these variations, the advice is the same: prepare your denomination count before visiting the bank. If your bank uses a combined slip, you can transfer the figures directly. If it uses a separate slip, you already have the numbers ready. Our <a href="/articles/cash-denomination-calculator-bank-deposits.html">guide to using denomination calculators for bank deposits</a> covers the process in detail for each major bank.</p>

                    <h2 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes When Filling Denomination Sheets</h2>

                    <p>The most frequent error is transposing the count and amount columns. A depositor intending to write &ldquo;23 notes&rdquo; in the count column and &ldquo;&#8377;11,500&rdquo; in the amount column accidentally writes the amount in the count column and vice versa. This is immediately flagged by the teller, but it wastes time as the slip must be corrected or rewritten.</p>

                    <p>Forgetting to include coins is another common mistake. Many people count their notes meticulously but leave the &#8377;5, &#8377;2, and &#8377;1 rows blank even when they have coins to deposit. The result is a mismatch between the denomination total and the physical cash, which triggers a recount at the counter. Arithmetic errors in subtotals are also common, particularly with denominations that produce awkward products &mdash; 37 &times; 200 = &#8377;7,400 is easy to miscalculate as &#8377;7,200 or &#8377;7,600 when doing mental math.</p>

                    <p>Other mistakes include not signing the denomination slip (which some banks require as an acknowledgement), using pencil instead of pen (banks typically require ink for financial documents), and not matching the denomination total with the amount written on the deposit slip. This last error is particularly problematic because the bank will process the deposit based on the physically verified amount, not the number on your slip, and any discrepancy can delay the credit to your account.</p>

                    <h2 id="templates">Free Denomination Sheet Templates &mdash; Download</h2>

                    <p>We are developing downloadable denomination sheet templates in both PDF and Excel formats that you can print and use at any Indian bank. The PDF template will be formatted for A4 paper with all nine denominations pre-printed, along with fields for your name, account number, date, and signature. The Excel template will include automatic formulas that calculate subtotals and the grand total as you enter counts, similar to how our online calculator works.</p>

                    <p>These templates will be available for free download at <a href="/templates/denomination-sheet.pdf">/templates/denomination-sheet.pdf</a> (PDF version) and <a href="/templates/denomination-sheet.xlsx">/templates/denomination-sheet.xlsx</a> (Excel version). Until the templates are ready, we recommend using our online calculator, which provides the same functionality with the added benefit of a clean, print-ready output that includes a date stamp and your calculated totals.</p>

                    <h2 id="online-calculator">How Our Online Calculator Replaces Paper Denomination Sheets</h2>

                    <p>The <a href="/">Cash Denomination Calculator</a> on our homepage effectively digitises the entire denomination sheet process. Instead of filling a paper form with a pen and a physical calculator, you open the tool on your phone or computer, enter the count for each denomination, and the tool does the rest.</p>

                    <p>The calculator multiplies each count by the denomination value to produce subtotals, sums all subtotals for the grand total, displays the total in the Indian numbering system (Lakhs and Crores), converts the total to words (required on bank documents), and generates a print-ready output that includes the date and a clean, tabular layout. When you click &ldquo;Print,&rdquo; the output is formatted to fit A4 paper with no Cash Denomination Calculator branding &mdash; it looks like a standard denomination sheet that any bank teller will recognise and accept.</p>

                    <p>For shopkeepers and small business owners who make daily deposits, this workflow eliminates the daily chore of filling paper slips. You count your cash, enter the numbers into the calculator, print the sheet, and take it to the bank. The entire process from sorting to printing takes under 5 minutes, compared to 15&ndash;20 minutes for the manual method. Read our <a href="/articles/how-to-use-indian-cash-denomination-calculator.html">step-by-step calculator guide</a> for a detailed walkthrough with screenshots and examples.</p>

                                <p>It depends on the bank and the amount. Most banks require a denomination breakdown for cash deposits above &#8377;50,000. For smaller amounts, some branches may still request one, especially if you are depositing a large number of coins. SBI and PNB generally require a denomination slip for all over-the-counter cash deposits, regardless of amount. It is good practice to always prepare one, as it speeds up the process.</p>

                                <p>Yes. Banks accept printed denomination sheets as supporting documents alongside their official deposit slip. The printed output from our Cash Denomination Calculator includes all denominations, counts, subtotals, the grand total, and a date stamp &mdash; matching the format banks expect. You may still need to fill the bank&rsquo;s own deposit slip, but the printed sheet serves as your accurate reference.</p>

                                <p>A deposit slip is the official bank form for recording a cash deposit, containing your name, account number, branch, amount, and signature. A denomination sheet is a supplementary document that breaks down the deposited amount into individual denominations. The deposit slip tells the bank how much you are depositing; the denomination sheet tells them exactly what notes and coins make up that amount. Both are typically required for over-the-counter cash deposits.</p>

                                <p>There is no RBI rule requiring a denomination sheet for deposits under &#8377;50,000. However, many bank branches request one as a matter of internal policy, especially for amounts involving a large number of notes. It is always good practice to prepare one, as it speeds up the deposit process and reduces the chance of counting errors at the counter.</p>
